App Overview
This app was developed as part of the Triple Ten educational curriculum. It enables users to search for news articles using keywords, displaying relevant results below the search bar. The retrieved articles are limited to those published within the past seven days from the search date.

Users can create an account and log in. If a user has previously logged in, the page will automatically display personalized content without requiring another login. Logged-in users can bookmark and unbookmark articles, which are stored on the "Saved Articles" page. Articles can be removed by clicking the trash can icon on the news card. Additionally, users can navigate to the original article source by clicking on the articleâ€™s title.

Technologies Used

The front end interface was created with help of React.js, CSS. The layout adapts to different screen resolutions using media queries. CSS classes follow BEM methodology. Articles search is performed by sending requests to News API.
